## Current Status

Update: Currently in debugging phase. Seems to work fine but needs more careful testing. If possible would like to add sound. 

# Chip-8 Emulator

Welcome to my Chip-8 Emulator project! This is my first major self project, and I'm excited to share it with you.

## About

This project is a Chip-8 emulator built in C++. I've always been fascinated by emulators and have used lots of them before. This sparked my interest in understanding how they work and led me to take up this project.

The Chip-8 is a simple, interpreted, programming language which was first used in some early home computers. By building this emulator, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of how software and hardware interact. Chip-8, being a simple and primitive system, allows you to grasp the fundamentals of things like opcodes, memory management, timers, and input/output without getting overwhelmed by the complexity of more advanced systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have SDL installed on your machine as it is a dependency for this project.

## Building

# TODO

## Usage

It takes only 1 extra command line argument: the name of the .ch8 file 

## Acknowledgements

This project is based on the following tutorial: Austin Morlan's Chip-8 Emulator Tutorial. I found it to be an excellent resource for understanding the working of the emulator.
